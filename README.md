# About this Project:

This project was my first project in Python, in which I created a class and functions to carry out Matrix Operations. 
The description of various files in the repository are as follows:

### **1. matrix.py:** ###

This is the heart of the entire project. I created a class called Matrix and defined functions for 
the operations like finding the determinant, trace of a matrix and also adding, subtracting, multiplying, 
scalar multiplying two matrices.

### **2. matrix_playground.ipynb:** ###

This is the main body of the project. In this file, we define the matrices and check for the results.

### **3. test.py:** ###

The test file has all the test cases to check whether the functions are properly implemented in **matrix.py**.

### **4. matrix_cheat_sheet.ipynb** ###

This is a collection of all the formulae for matrix operation, which was referenced while creating the functions in **matrix.py**.

# Required feedback:

I would love to get your opinion on making the code more concise and optimize it for better runtime.
